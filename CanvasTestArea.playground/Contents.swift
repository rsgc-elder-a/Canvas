 # Canvas
 
 The Canvas class provides methods that allow basic shapes to be drawn on a Cartesian plane.
 
 - callout(Experiment):
 
    Uncomment line 27 so that the axes of the plane are automatically drawn.
 
    Where is the origin?
 
    In what direction do values on the *x* and *y* axes increase?
